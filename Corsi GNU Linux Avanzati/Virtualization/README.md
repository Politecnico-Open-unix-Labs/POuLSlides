Compile
=======

These slides are compiled through CuteMarkEd a markdown slide/html editor and exporter written in Qt. To compile open and export them to 
html.

All the images needs to be converted to jpeg, non vectorial version, to maximize browser compatibility


Export
======

I use deck2pdf to export html slides to pdf.
